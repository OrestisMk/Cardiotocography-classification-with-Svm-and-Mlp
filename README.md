# Comparison-Svm-and-Mlp
This project compares the classification accurasy of SVM and Mlp on cardiotography dataset. For the purpose of this project ,we added suspicious and pathologic classes and created a new variable as a target value with 2 classes (normal, suspicious/pathologic). Although, we
combined these two, the classes remain highly imbalance. So, In order to tackle this problem SMOTE imbalance method is used.
